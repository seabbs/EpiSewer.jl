# Standard EpiAware docstring conventions. DocStringExtensions `@template`
# blocks give every function, type, and the module a consistent docstring
# layout: a signature header, the authored prose, and — for types — an
# auto-generated field list.
#
# PACKAGE-OWNED: scaffold writes this once and never overwrites it. To
# activate it, `include` this file near the TOP of the package module,
# AFTER the module's `using DocStringExtensions: ...` and BEFORE any
# docstrings are defined (a `@template` only applies to docstrings written
# after it in the same module):
#
#     module MyPackage
#     using DocStringExtensions: @template, DOCSTRING, EXPORTS, IMPORTS,
#                                TYPEDEF, TYPEDFIELDS, TYPEDSIGNATURES
#     include("docstrings.jl")   # registers the @template conventions
#     # ... the rest of the package, with docstrings ...
#     end
#
# Add DocStringExtensions to the package `[deps]`. `scaffold_generate` wires
# both for a fresh package automatically. Pairs with `test_docstring_format`
# and the Documenter + DocumenterVitepress build in `docs/make.jl`.
