#src The AD page: a cost report, plus the short backend-choice note that
#src carries the `ad-backends` anchor. Lives under `docs/src/benchmarks/`
#src with its own top-level "Benchmarks" nav group, alongside the

#src
#src There was a separate `ad-backends.jl` tutorial under Getting started
#src carrying a support table and a how-to-choose narrative. It is retired:
#src the support table duplicated the README's per-backend coverage badge
#src row and this page's own per-backend scenario coverage, and the generic
#src advice belongs to the ecosystem rather than to any one package
#src (epiaware.github.io#28). Package pages across the org link to its
#src `@ref ad-backends` anchor, so that anchor now lives on the "Choosing a
#src backend" section below and must stay there.
#src
#src The page body is re-applied on every update so it stays kit-current;
#src everything package-specific it reports (scenarios, backends,
#src broken/skip declarations) is read at docs-build time from the
#src package-owned `test/ADFixtures` registry, so declare a broken scenario
#src there, never here. If this page cannot execute for this package, park
#src it via `FORCE_STUB_TUTORIALS` in `docs/docs_config.jl` instead of

# [AD backend comparison](@id ad-comparison)

What each AD backend costs on EpiSewer.jl's shared AD scenario set, so a
decision between backends can be made from numbers rather than the general
pattern alone.

Which backends are supported is the per-backend badge row in the
[README](https://github.com/EpiAware/EpiSewer.jl#readme), which reports each backend's
CI status and its coverage flag from the gradient suite.

## Benchmark

`DifferentiationInterfaceTest.benchmark_differentiation` runs every
(backend, scenario) pair the registry supports.
Combinations declared broken or skipped in the registry are excluded from
their backend's rows, so they show up as reduced scenario coverage in the
`Scenarios` column below, rather than as timings of gradients that are
wrong or crash.
The figures are the prepared per-call cost.
DifferentiationInterface prepares each backend once, recording a tape for
ReverseDiff and compiling a rule for Enzyme and Mooncake, and we time the
reused operator, so that one-off preparation is excluded.
This matches repeated use such as an MCMC run, where preparation is
amortised over many gradient calls.
Each backend's time and allocations are then divided by the ForwardDiff
value on the same scenario, so ForwardDiff sits at 1.0 by construction;
values below 1.0 are faster (or lighter), above 1.0 slower (or heavier).
Timings use short per-measurement budgets so the page stays cheap to
build; treat small differences as indicative rather than exact.

## [Choosing a backend](@id ad-backends)

The numbers above are this package's scenarios, but the shape of them is
general.
Forward mode (ForwardDiff, Enzyme forward, Mooncake forward) costs one pass
per parameter, so it wins when the parameter count is small.
Reverse mode (ReverseDiff, Enzyme reverse, Mooncake reverse) costs one pass
per output regardless of the parameter count, so it pays off once this
package's quantities sit inside a larger model with many latent parameters.
Turing's
[AD guidance](https://turinglang.org/docs/usage/automatic-differentiation/)
puts the crossover around 20 parameters.

ForwardDiff is the simplest fast default below that and needs no
configuration.
Above it, switch to a reverse-mode backend through the sampler's `adtype`,
for example `sample(model, NUTS(; adtype = AutoMooncake()), 1000)`.
The surest choice is to benchmark the backends on your own model.

Where the registry enables Enzyme, the standard configuration defers
per-value activity decisions to runtime:

```julia
using ADTypes, Enzyme
AutoEnzyme(mode = Enzyme.set_runtime_activity(Enzyme.Reverse))
```

Runtime activity is not free. On paths that do not need it, it can make
Enzyme several times slower, so where one Enzyme configuration is applied
to every scenario the rows for it above are conservative.

When a backend misbehaves, start with ForwardDiff: it fails with ordinary
Julia `MethodError`s that point at the offending call, where Enzyme and
Mooncake report at the compiled-IR level.
`test/ad/run_selected.jl` checks a single (backend, scenario) pair without
running the full suite:

```
julia --project=test/ad test/ad/run_selected.jl --backend enzyme --scenario AR
```

A combination that is genuinely broken is declared in the `ADFixtures`
registry (`backend_broken_scenarios`, or `backend_skip_scenarios` when it
cannot run at all), which excludes it here and marks it `@test_broken` in
the gradient tests rather than leaving the suite red.

## Reproducing this page

The numbers above are measured on the docs-build machine, so they reflect
that CPU.
To regenerate locally:

```
task docs
```

or, equivalently:

```
julia --project=docs docs/make.jl
```

## See also

- `test/ad/` holds the gradient tests as tagged `@testitem`s, validated
  against a ForwardDiff reference with
  `DifferentiationInterfaceTest.test_differentiation`. Pass a backend tag
  (e.g. `TAG=enzyme_reverse task test-ad-backend`) to run a single backend,
  as the per-backend CI does.
- `test/ADFixtures` is the package-owned registry this page renders from;
  scenarios, backends, and broken/skip declarations all live there.
