const LIGHT_TUTORIALS = String[]

# Heavy tutorials (live MCMC fits, multi-backend AD, plotting) each run once

const TUTORIAL_STUBS = Pair{String, String}[]

# Heavy tutorials that always render from their `TUTORIAL_STUBS` heading and
# never execute, independent of `--skip-notebooks` — the escape hatch for a
# tutorial with its own problem (e.g. a model that never terminates). Leave
# empty; every heavy tutorial without such a problem should execute. Shared
# with the `docs/src/benchmarks/` pipeline below, so `ad-comparison.jl` is
# parked by naming it here too.
const FORCE_STUB_TUTORIALS = String[]

# Heavy tutorials that build against their own environment instead of the
# shared `docs/` one, as `"file.jl" => "environment/dir"` pairs. The directory
# is relative to `docs/` unless absolute. The escape hatch for a dependency
# that cannot co-resolve with the rest of the docs environment, e.g. one
# capping a shared dependency below the version this package's own extension
# needs; everything else belongs in `docs/Project.toml`.
#
# The environment is package-owned: the kit never writes it, exactly as it
# never writes `docs/Project.toml`. Create the directory with a
# `Project.toml` declaring the tutorial's dependencies plus `Literate` (the
# tutorial runs in a subprocess resolving against that environment alone),
# and a `[sources]` entry pointing at the package root so `using` this
# package resolves. It is instantiated before the tutorial runs, and a
# missing or incomplete one fails the build rather than quietly stubbing the
# page. Shared with the `docs/src/benchmarks/` pipeline below, matched by
# source file name.
#
# One environment per tutorial that needs one, under `environments/` (so
# `"environments/my-tutorial"` here, `docs/environments/my-tutorial/` on
# disk). Each resolves on its own manifest, so two tutorials wanting
# incompatible versions simply get one environment each. The managed
# Dependabot config watches that path and nowhere else: an environment
# elsewhere still builds, but its dependencies are never updated.
const TUTORIAL_ENVIRONMENTS = Pair{String, String}[]

# How many heavy tutorials execute at once, each still in its own subprocess.
# `1` runs them one after another, which is the right default: memory rather
# than cores is what bounds a sampling tutorial, and two concurrent Turing
# subprocesses can each hold several GB.
#
# Raise it when this package has several heavy tutorials and its docs build
# is running long — the tutorials have no ordering between them, so the wall
# clock falls close to linearly. The thread budget is divided, not
# multiplied: each worker is launched with `JULIA_NUM_THREADS ÷ workers`
# threads (at least one), so `2` on a 4-core runner gives two tutorials two
# threads each rather than four apiece. Chains within a tutorial then get
# fewer threads, so this trades intra-tutorial parallelism for
# inter-tutorial parallelism. It wins when there are more tutorials than
# there are chains to spread over.
#
# Watch memory before raising it above 2 on a standard CI runner. Under a
# parallel build each tutorial's output is printed as one block when it
# finishes, and every failure is named at the end.
