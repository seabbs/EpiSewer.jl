# MANAGED by EpiAwarePackageTools.scaffold — do not edit by hand.
#
# Thin entry point for the standard EpiAware documentation build. All build
# logic lives in `EpiAwarePackageTools.DocsBuild.build_docs`; this file only
# wires `pages.jl` (managed, regenerated on every sync unless the package
# forked it -- see EpiAwarePackageTools' `_apply_pages`) + the package-owned
# `docs_config.jl` into that call, so it can be re-applied on every `update`
# without losing package content.
#
# `build_docs`:
#   - runs the Literate tutorial pipeline (light in-process, heavy one per
#     subprocess) driven by `docs_config.jl`; under `--skip-notebooks` light
#     tutorials still render in-process and only heavy ones fall back to
#     heading stubs; any `FORCE_STUB_TUTORIALS` entry always stubs,
#     independent of that flag, while its heavy siblings run normally, and
#     any `TUTORIAL_ENVIRONMENTS` entry resolves against the environment it
#     names instead of the shared docs one, and `HEAVY_TUTORIAL_WORKERS`
#     runs that many heavy tutorials at once,
#   - runs the same pipeline over `docs/src/benchmarks/`, driven by
#     `HEAVY_BENCHMARKS`/`BENCHMARK_STUBS`, so a benchmark report gets its
#     own nav group rather than sitting under Tutorials,
#   - generates `src/index.md` from the README (badges stripped, any
#     `INDEX_STRIP_SECTIONS` removed, link rewrites applied),
#   - generates `src/release-notes.md` from the repo's published GitHub
#     releases, fetched at build time (a link-out when they cannot be read),
#   - generates `src/benchmarks/over-time.md` (skeleton + package-owned
#     `docs/benchmarks.md` prose + rendered performance history),
#   - generates the API pages from the module's documented bindings, and
#   - renders + deploys with DocumenterVitepress.
#
# Build it with `task docs` (or `julia --project=docs docs/make.jl`).
